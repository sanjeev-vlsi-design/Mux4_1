4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX4_1)
This repository provides an overview and design details for a 4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX). A multiplexer is a fundamental combinational circuit widely used in digital systems to select one input from multiple data inputs and forward it to a single output line based on control signals.

Overview
The 4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX4_1) is a combinational logic circuit that selects one of four input signals and forwards it to the output based on two selection lines. It demonstrates how logic can be designed to manage and route data effectively in digital circuits.

Features
Four Inputs (I0, I1, I2, I3): The MUX takes four distinct input signals.
Single Output (Y): Produces one output based on the selected input.
Two Selection Lines (S1, S0): Used to determine which input is passed to the output.
High-Speed Operation: Minimal delay between input selection and output due to combinational logic.
